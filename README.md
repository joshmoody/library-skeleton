# Library Skeleton

Skeleton for building PHP packages. It is pre-configured for use with Composer, PHPUnit, and CodeSniffer. These three items should be in *every* PHP Library.

## Installation

``` bash
$ composer create-project joshmoody/library-skeleton your-project-name
```

See [README_SAMPLE.md](README_SAMPLE.md) for an example README you can use in your packages with badges and standard installation instructions.
